Elements can have special meaing but no special styling (Semantic elements)
e.g. <p> , <main>, <article>, <header>, <footer>

Need all these semantic elements for accessibility, Search Engine Optimisation, convery the correct data
SEO: Need to have a certain kind of structure so that the search engine can look for the keywords.
e.g. what are the links and content that are not visible but still in the HTML docuemnt

<title></title> in the <head> display the tab title.
heading 1 to heading 6
paragraph element -> clear designation between paragraph
<br> bad practice to use break to separate the paragraph. it would be easier to edit if only using paragraph tags
<br> is difficult to edit.
<ul>,<ol>,<li> -> for list
<a> -> for links. Can hover. Usually have a 'href' attribute for the link.
<img > is a void image. There is no closing tags for this.
img - src is for the link of the image, alt is for accessibility ,incase the iamge is not there

combine elements e.g. <a href = ''><img src = ''><a> make an image into a link!
